    "### What is Object-Oriented Programming `(OOP)`?\n",
    "    \n",
    "- OOP involves bundling together variables and functions into \"classes\" -- aka creating your own data types.\n",
    "- Python is fundamentally object-oriented -- everything in Python is an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why `(OOP)`?\n",
    "\n",
    "You're actually very familiar with some OOP ideas. Instantiations of `DataFrame`, `LinearRegression`, and `StandardScaler` have all followed the traditional OOP pattern. If you understand how to manipulate those objects, you know the basics of OOP!\n",
    "\n",
    "But, we don't know how to **make our own templates for objects** (called \"classes\") yet. That's what we're going to explore today.\n",
    "\n",
    "In data science, we don't make our own classes very often. But it's absolutely imperative for data scientists to be comfortable with the idea, and to recognize when making a class is a good idea. **If data science is a cross between statistics and computer science, this lesson falls more on the computer science side.** After today's lesson, a lot of the magic surrounding what we've been doing up until now should \"click\"."

    "<p style=\"color:brown; font-weight:bold\">The class should meet all the following specifications. Different students may interpret each of these specifications differently. Use your best judgment to determine what you think would be most useful to potential banking software! I have graded the specifications from easy to hard. But none of them are extremely difficult. Try to make it to the end!</p>\n",

    "* Each account should have an `interest_rate` (e.g. `0.03`)\n",
    "* Each account should have a starting `balance` of 0\n",
    "* The class should have `.withdraw()` and `.deposit()` methods.\n",

    "**Difficuly Mode: Medium**\n",

    "**Difficuly Mode: Hard**\n",
    "* If fraud is detected, the bank wants the ability to freeze the account. Add `.freeze()` and `.unfreeze()` methods. While an account is frozen, do not allow depositing or withdrawing.\n",
    "* The user can only make 10 withdrawals a year. Create an instance variable that keeps track of these withdrawals, and throws an error if a user tries to make an 11th withdrawal.\n",
    "* Create a `.year_end()` method which implies the banking year has ended. What _two_ things above happen at the end of a year?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Difficuly Mode: Very Hard *The things that you'll need to look up online in order to learn to do:***\n",
    "* Create a **class variable** (different from an instance variable!) that keeps track of the total number of bank accounts created.\n",
    "* Temporarily freeze a bank account at end of year if a user deposits more than $1 Million in one instance during the year.\n",
    "* Some of the methods we've created should not be allowed to be called by the user (e.g., the user shouldn't be allowed to `.accrue_interest()` whenever they want!). Turn these methods into _private methods_.\n",
