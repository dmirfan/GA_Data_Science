    "The goal of both is to condense derived words down into their base form, to reduce the collection of words that the model's exposed to, and to explicitly correlate words with similar meaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Stemming takes a more crude approach** by just chopping off the ending of a word using heuristics, without any understanding of the context in which a word is used. Because of that, stemming may or may not return an actual word in the dictionary. And it's usually less accurate, but the benefit is that it's faster because the rules are quite simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Lemmatizing leverages more informed analysis** to create groups of words with similar meaning based on the context around the word, part of speech, and other factors. Lemmatizers will always return a dictionary word. And because of the additional context it's considered, this is typically more accurate. But the downside is that it may be more computationally expensive."
